# python-challenge

I created my Repository first thing first in Git Hub, and then I had added folders to the repository in Github thinking it was right. I had tutoring scheduled for Tuesday night to set up my SSH Key. However, by Tuesday, I had my SSH Key set up, so I asked how to clone the repository from Git Hub and Git Lab. With the tutor, Nelson, he taught me more by step how to clone. I was then able to correctly set up my Repository in explorer and make it appear in VS Code. 

Then Wednesday and Today, Thursday, I work to complete my assignemnt of Challenge 3. 
PyPoll:
    I got to complete it first. As  I was trying to fix mistakes, other mistakes came along the way. 
    I got a summary of the table under Analysis. However, at the end there was an error coming at the beggining of the code that my path couldn't be found. I asked Learing Asssistants from SLack and TA's thet both told me the same thing to check my path. I had it right, so I just decided to leave it as is before I changed my code to something worse. 
PyBank:
    In PyBank, I have the same mistake as in PyPoll with the path. I decided to leave it there than not having no code. I tried my best in creating the analysis, but I wasn't successful. 

I'm still adjusting to coding, and I tried my best.
I know this isn't comploete, but it's better to try than not trying.
